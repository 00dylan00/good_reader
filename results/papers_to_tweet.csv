scFed: federated learning for cell type classification with scRNA-seq.,38221903,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38221903/,https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbad507,"['cell type', 'classification', 'federated learning', 'scRNA-seq']","The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and complexity in biological tissues. However, the nature of large, sparse scRNA-seq datasets and privacy regulations present challenges for efficient cell identification. Federated learning provides a solution, allowing efficient and private data use. Here, we introduce scFed, a unified federated learning framework that allows for benchmarking of four classification algorithms without violating data privacy, including single-cell-specific and general-purpose classifiers. We evaluated scFed using eight publicly available scRNA-seq datasets with diverse sizes, species and technologies, assessing its performance via intra-dataset and inter-dataset experimental setups. We find that scFed performs well on a variety of datasets with competitive accuracy to centralized models. Though Transformer-based model excels in centralized training, its performance slightly lags behind single-cell-specific model within the scFed framework, coupled with a notable time complexity concern. Our study not only helps select suitable cell identification methods but also highlights federated learning's potential for privacy-preserving, collaborative biomedical research.",1,The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and complexity in biological tissues..

DockOpt: A Tool for Automatic Optimization of Docking Models.,38206771,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38206771/,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01406,[],"Molecular docking is a widely used technique for leveraging protein structure for ligand discovery, but it remains difficult to utilize due to limitations that have not been adequately addressed. Despite some progress toward automation, docking still requires expert guidance, hindering its adoption by a broader range of investigators. To make docking more accessible, we developed a new utility called DockOpt, which automates the creation, evaluation, and optimization of docking models prior to their deployment in large-scale prospective screens. DockOpt outperforms our previous automated pipeline across all 43 targets in the DUDE-Z benchmark data set, and the generated models for 84% of targets demonstrate sufficient enrichment to warrant their use in prospective screens, with normalized LogAUC values of at least 15%. DockOpt is available as part of the Python package Pydock3 included in the UCSF DOCK 3.8 distribution, which is available for free to academic researchers at https://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu and free for everyone upon registration at https://tldr.docking.org.",1,"Molecular docking is a widely used technique for leveraging protein structure for ligand discovery..

Apparent simplicity and emergent robustness in the control of the Escherichia coli cell cycle.,38157847,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38157847/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2023.12.001,"['bacterial cell cycle', 'cell division', 'cell size', 'chromosome replication', 'nucleoid segregation', 'quantitative microscopy-based phenotyping']","To examine how bacteria achieve robust cell proliferation across diverse conditions, we developed a method that quantifies 77 cell morphological, cell cycle, and growth phenotypes of a fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli strain and >800 gene deletion derivatives under multiple nutrient conditions. This approach revealed extensive phenotypic plasticity and deviating mutant phenotypes were often nutrient dependent. From this broad phenotypic landscape emerged simple and robust unifying rules (laws) that connect DNA replication initiation, nucleoid segregation, FtsZ ring formation, and cell constriction to specific aspects of cell size (volume, length, or added length) at the population level. Furthermore, completion of cell division followed the initiation of cell constriction after a constant time delay across strains and nutrient conditions, identifying cell constriction as a key control point for cell size determination. Our work provides a population-level description of the governing principles by which E. coli integrates cell cycle processes and growth rate with cell size to achieve its robust proliferative capability.

SMN2 is a paralogous gene with a C•G-to-T•A transition in exon 7, which causes this exon to be skipped in most SMN2 transcripts, and results in low levels of the protein survival motor neuron (SMN). Here we show, in fibroblasts derived from patients with SMA and in a mouse model of SMA that, irrespective of the mutations in SMN1, adenosine base editors can be optimized to target the SMN2 exon-7 mutation or nearby regulatory elements to restore the normal expression of SMN. After optimizing and testing more than 100 guide RNAs and base editors, and leveraging Cas9 variants with high editing fidelity that are tolerant of different protospacer-adjacent motifs, we achieved the reversion of the exon-7 mutation via an A•T-to-G•C edit in up to 99% of fibroblasts, with concomitant increases in the levels of the SMN2 exon-7 transcript and of SMN.
