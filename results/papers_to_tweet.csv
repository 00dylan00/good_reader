CEMIG: prediction of the cis-regulatory motif using the de Bruijn graph from ATAC-seq.,38189539,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38189539/,https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbad505,"['algorithms', 'chromatin accessibility', 'cluster analysis', 'graph theory', 'motif finding']","Sequence motif discovery algorithms enhance the identification of novel deoxyribonucleic acid sequences with pivotal biological significance, especially transcription factor (TF)-binding motifs. The advent of assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) has broadened the toolkit for motif characterization. Nonetheless, prevailing computational approaches have focused on delineating TF-binding footprints, with motif discovery receiving less attention. Herein, we present Cis rEgulatory Motif Influence using de Bruijn Graph (CEMIG), an algorithm leveraging de Bruijn and Hamming distance graph paradigms to predict and map motif sites. Assessment on 129 ATAC-seq datasets from the Cistrome Data Browser demonstrates CEMIG's exceptional performance, surpassing three established methodologies on four evaluative metrics. CEMIG accurately identifies both cell-type-specific and common TF motifs within GM12878 and K562 cell lines, demonstrating its comparative genomic capabilities in the identification of evolutionary conservation and cell-type specificity. In-depth transcriptional and functional genomic studies have validated the functional relevance of CEMIG-identified motifs across various cell types. CEMIG is available at https://github.com/OSU-BMBL/CEMIG, developed in C++ to ensure cross-platform compatibility with Linux, macOS and Windows operating systems.",1,CEMIG is an algorithm leveraging de Bruijn and Hamming distance graph paradigms to predict and map motif sites.
Auditing the inference processes of medical-image classifiers by leveraging generative AI and the expertise of physicians.,38155295,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38155295/,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-023-01160-9,[],"The inferences of most machine-learning models powering medical artificial intelligence are difficult to interpret. Here we report a general framework for model auditing that combines insights from medical experts with a highly expressive form of explainable artificial intelligence. Specifically, we leveraged the expertise of dermatologists for the clinical task of differentiating melanomas from melanoma 'lookalikes' on the basis of dermoscopic and clinical images of the skin, and the power of generative models to render 'counterfactual' images to understand the 'reasoning' processes of five medical-image classifiers. By altering image attributes to produce analogous images that elicit a different prediction by the classifiers, and by asking physicians to identify medically meaningful features in the images, the counterfactual images revealed that the classifiers rely both on features used by human dermatologists, such as lesional pigmentation patterns, and on undesirable features, such as background skin texture and colour balance. The framework can be applied to any specialized medical domain to make the powerful inference processes of machine-learning models medically understandable.",1,The inferences of most machine-learning models powering medical artificial intelligence are difficult to interpret.
Performance and Analysis of the Alchemical Transfer Method for Binding-Free-Energy Predictions of Diverse Ligands.,38147877,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38147877/,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01705,[],"The Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) is herein validated against the relative binding-free energies (RBFEs) of a diverse set of protein-ligand complexes. We employed a streamlined setup workflow, a bespoke force field, and AToM-OpenMM software to compute the RBFEs of the benchmark set prepared by Schindler and collaborators at Merck KGaA. This benchmark set includes examples of standard small R-group ligand modifications as well as more challenging scenarios, such as large R-group changes, scaffold hopping, formal charge changes, and charge-shifting transformations. The novel coordinate perturbation scheme and a dual-topology approach of ATM address some of the challenges of single-topology alchemical RBFE methods. Specifically, ATM eliminates the need for splitting electrostatic and Lennard-Jones interactions, atom mapping, defining ligand regions, and postcorrections for charge-changing perturbations. Thus, ATM is simpler and more broadly applicable than conventional alchemical methods, especially for scaffold-hopping and charge-changing transformations. Here, we performed well over 500 RBFE calculations for eight protein targets and found that ATM achieves accuracy comparable to that of existing state-of-the-art methods, albeit with larger statistical fluctuations. We discuss insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of the ATM method that will inform future deployments. This study confirms that ATM can be applied as a production tool for RBFE predictions across a wide range of perturbation types within a unified, open-source framework.",1,
Chemprop: A Machine Learning Package for Chemical Property Prediction.,38147829,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38147829/,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01250,[],"Deep learning has become a powerful and frequently employed tool for the prediction of molecular properties, thus creating a need for open-source and versatile software solutions that can be operated by nonexperts. Among the current approaches, directed message-passing neural networks (D-MPNNs) have proven to perform well on a variety of property prediction tasks. The software package Chemprop implements the D-MPNN architecture and offers simple, easy, and fast access to machine-learned molecular properties. Compared to its initial version, we present a multitude of new Chemprop functionalities such as the support of multimolecule properties, reactions, atom/bond-level properties, and spectra. Further, we incorporate various uncertainty quantification and calibration methods along with related metrics as well as pretraining and transfer learning workflows, improved hyperparameter optimization, and other customization options concerning loss functions or atom/bond features. We benchmark D-MPNN models trained using Chemprop with the new reaction, atom-level, and spectra functionality on a variety of property prediction data sets, including MoleculeNet and SAMPL, and observe state-of-the-art performance on the prediction of water-octanol partition coefficients, reaction barrier heights, atomic partial charges, and absorption spectra. Chemprop enables out-of-the-box training of D-MPNN models for a variety of problem settings in fast, user-friendly, and open-source software.",2,Deep learning has become a powerful and frequently employed tool for the prediction of molecular properties.

Programming co-assembled peptide nanofiber morphology via anionic amino acid type: Insights from molecular dynamics simulations.,38048311,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38048311/,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011685,[],"Co-assembling peptides can be crafted into supramolecular biomaterials for use in biotechnological applications, such as cell culture scaffolds, drug delivery, biosensors, and tissue engineering. Peptide co-assembly refers to the spontaneous organization of two different peptides into a supramolecular architecture. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the effect of anionic amino acid type on co-assembly dynamics and nanofiber structure in binary CATCH(+/-) peptide systems. CATCH peptide sequences follow a general pattern: CQCFCFCFCQC, where all C's are either a positively charged or a negatively charged amino acid. Specifically, we investigate the effect of substituting aspartic acid residues for the glutamic acid residues in the established CATCH(6E-) molecule, while keeping CATCH(6K+) unchanged. Our results show that structures consisting of CATCH(6K+) and CATCH(6D-) form flatter β-sheets, have stronger interactions between charged residues on opposing β-sheet faces, and have slower co-assembly kinetics than structures consisting of CATCH(6K+) and CATCH(6E-). Knowledge of the effect of sidechain type on assembly dynamics and fibrillar structure can help guide the development of advanced biomaterials and grant insight into sequence-to-structure relationships.",1,Peptide co-assembly refers to the spontaneous organization of two different peptides into a supramolecular architecture.
