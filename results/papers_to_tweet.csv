Predictive coding networks for temporal prediction.,38557984,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38557984/,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011183,[],"One of the key problems the brain faces is inferring the state of the world from a sequence of dynamically changing stimuli, and it is not yet clear how the sensory system achieves this task. A well-established computational framework for describing perceptual processes in the brain is provided by the theory of predictive coding. Although the original proposals of predictive coding have discussed temporal prediction, later work developing this theory mostly focused on static stimuli, and key questions on neural implementation and computational properties of temporal predictive coding networks remain open. Here, we address these questions and present a formulation of the temporal predictive coding model that can be naturally implemented in recurrent networks, in which activity dynamics rely only on local inputs to the neurons, and learning only utilises local Hebbian plasticity. Additionally, we show that temporal predictive coding networks can approximate the performance of the Kalman filter in predicting behaviour of linear systems, and behave as a variant of a Kalman filter which does not track its own subjective posterior variance. Importantly, temporal predictive coding networks can achieve similar accuracy as the Kalman filter without performing complex mathematical operations, but just employing simple computations that can be implemented by biological networks. Moreover, when trained with natural dynamic inputs, we found that temporal predictive coding can produce Gabor-like, motion-sensitive receptive fields resembling those observed in real neurons in visual areas. In addition, we demonstrate how the model can be effectively generalized to nonlinear systems. Overall, models presented in this paper show how biologically plausible circuits can predict future stimuli and may guide research on understanding specific neural circuits in brain areas involved in temporal prediction.",2,Predictive coding is a well-established computational framework for describing perceptual processes in the brain.

To exploit this knowledge base, researchers relate a connectome's structure to neuronal function, often by studying individual neuron cell types. Vast libraries of fly driver lines expressing fluorescent reporter genes in sets of neurons have been created and imaged using confocal light microscopy (LM), enabling the targeting of neurons for experimentation. However, creating a fly line for driving gene expression within a single neuron found in an EM connectome remains a challenge, as it typically requires identifying a pair of driver lines where only the neuron of interest is expressed in both. This task and other emerging scientific workflows require finding similar neurons across large data sets imaged using different modalities.",1, Neuroscience research in Drosophila is benefiting from large-scale connectomics efforts using electron microscopy.
Mathematical models of Plasmodium vivax transmission: A scoping review.,38483975,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38483975/,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011931,[],"Plasmodium vivax is one of the most geographically widespread malaria parasites in the world, primarily found across South-East Asia, Latin America, and parts of Africa. One of the significant characteristics of the P. vivax parasite is its ability to remain dormant in the human liver as hypnozoites and subsequently reactivate after the initial infection (i.e. relapse infections). Mathematical modelling approaches have been widely applied to understand P. vivax dynamics and predict the impact of intervention outcomes. Models that capture P. vivax dynamics differ from those that capture P. falciparum dynamics, as they must account for relapses caused by the activation of hypnozoites. In this article, we provide a scoping review of mathematical models that capture P. vivax transmission dynamics published between January 1988 and May 2023. The primary objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive summary of the mathematical models and techniques used to model P. vivax dynamics. In doing so, we aim to assist researchers working on mathematical epidemiology, disease transmission, and other aspects of P. vivax malaria by highlighting best practices in currently published models and highlighting where further model development is required. We categorise P. vivax models according to whether a deterministic or agent-based approach was used. We provide an overview of the different strategies used to incorporate the parasite's biology, use of multiple scales (within-host and population-level), superinfection, immunity, and treatment interventions. In most of the published literature, the rationale for different modelling approaches was driven by the research question at hand. Some models focus on the parasites' complicated biology, while others incorporate simplified assumptions to avoid model complexity. Overall, the existing literature on mathematical models for P. vivax encompasses various aspects of the parasite's dynamics. We recommend that future research should focus on refining how key aspects of P. vivax dynamics are modelled, including spatial heterogeneity in exposure risk and heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection, the accumulation of hypnozoite variation, the interaction between P. falciparum and P. vivax, acquisition of immunity, and recovery under superinfection.",1,Plasmodium vivax is one of the most geographically widespread malaria parasites in the world.

However, the current DL models still face limitations due to the low-quality database, inaccurate input representation and inappropriate model architecture.

Methods and considerations for estimating parameters in biophysically detailed neural models with simulation based inference.,38408099,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38408099/,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011108,[],"Biophysically detailed neural models are a powerful technique to study neural dynamics in health and disease with a growing number of established and openly available models. A major challenge in the use of such models is that parameter inference is an inherently difficult and unsolved problem. Identifying unique parameter distributions that can account for observed neural dynamics, and differences across experimental conditions, is essential to their meaningful use. Recently, simulation based inference (SBI) has been proposed as an approach to perform Bayesian inference to estimate parameters in detailed neural models. SBI overcomes the challenge of not having access to a likelihood function, which has severely limited inference methods in such models, by leveraging advances in deep learning to perform density estimation. While the substantial methodological advancements offered by SBI are promising, their use in large scale biophysically detailed models is challenging and methods for doing so have not been established, particularly when inferring parameters that can account for time series waveforms. We provide guidelines and considerations on how SBI can be applied to estimate time series waveforms in biophysically detailed neural models starting with a simplified example and extending to specific applications to common MEG/EEG waveforms using the the large scale neural modeling framework of the Human Neocortical Neurosolver. Specifically, we describe how to estimate and compare results from example oscillatory and event related potential simulations. We also describe how diagnostics can be used to assess the quality and uniqueness of the posterior estimates. The methods described provide a principled foundation to guide future applications of SBI in a wide variety of applications that use detailed models to study neural dynamics.",1,Biophysically detailed neural models are a powerful technique to study neural dynamics in health and disease.
Hound: a novel tool for automated mapping of genotype to phenotype in bacterial genomes assembled de novo.,38385882,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38385882/,https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbae057,"['antibiotic resistance', 'genomic surveillance', 'reference-free']","Increasing evidence suggests that microbial species have a strong within species genetic heterogeneity. This can be problematic for the analysis of prokaryote genomes, which commonly relies on a reference genome to guide the assembly process. Differences between reference and sample genomes will therefore introduce errors in final assembly, jeopardizing the detection from structural variations to point mutations-critical for genomic surveillance of antibiotic resistance. Here we present Hound, a pipeline that integrates publicly available tools to assemble prokaryote genomes de novo, detect user-given genes by similarity to report mutations found in the coding sequence, promoter, as well as relative gene copy number within the assembly. Importantly, Hound can use the query sequence as a guide to merge contigs, and reconstruct genes that were fragmented by the assembler. To showcase Hound, we screened through 5032 bacterial whole-genome sequences isolated from farmed animals and human infections, using the amino acid sequence encoded by blaTEM-1, to detect and predict resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate which is driven by over-expression of this gene. We believe this tool can facilitate the analysis of prokaryote species that currently lack a reference genome, and can be scaled either up to build automated systems for genomic surveillance or down to integrate into antibiotic susceptibility point-of-care diagnostics.",1,Hound is a pipeline that integrates publicly available tools to assemble prokaryote genomes de novo.
Acceleration of Graph Neural Network-Based Prediction Models in Chemistry via Co-Design Optimization on Intelligence Processing Units.,38382011,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38382011/,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01312,[],"Atomic structure prediction and associated property calculations are the bedrock of chemical physics. Since high-fidelity ab initio modeling techniques for computing the structure and properties can be prohibitively expensive, this motivates the development of machine-learning (ML) models that make these predictions more efficiently. Training graph neural networks over large atomistic databases introduces unique computational challenges, such as the need to process millions of small graphs with variable size and support communication patterns that are distinct from learning over large graphs, such as social networks. We demonstrate a novel hardware-software codesign approach to scale up the training of atomistic graph neural networks (GNN) for structure and property prediction. First, to eliminate redundant computation and memory associated with alternative padding techniques and to improve throughput via minimizing communication, we formulate the effective coalescing of the batches of variable-size atomistic graphs as the bin packing problem and introduce a hardware-agnostic algorithm to pack these batches. In addition, we propose hardware-specific optimizations, including a planner and vectorization for the gather-scatter operations targeted for Graphcore's Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU), as well as model-specific optimizations such as merged communication collectives and optimized softplus. Putting these all together, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed codesign approach by providing an implementation of a well-established atomistic GNN on the Graphcore IPUs. We evaluate the training performance on multiple atomistic graph databases with varying degrees of graph counts, sizes, and sparsity. We demonstrate that such a codesign approach can reduce the training time of atomistic GNNs and can improve their performance by up to 1.5Ã— compared to the baseline implementation of the model on the IPUs. Additionally, we compare our IPU implementation with a Nvidia GPU-based implementation and show that our atomistic GNN implementation on the IPUs can run 1.8Ã— faster on average compared to the execution time on the GPUs.",1,Atomic structure prediction and associated property calculations are the bedrock of chemical physics.

AlphaFold2 achieves high discrimination between interacting and non-interacting proteins, and the cases of misclassifications can either be rescued by revisiting the input sequences or can suggest false positives and negatives in the data set. AlphaFold2 is thus not impaired by the compatibility between protein structures and has the potential to be applied on a large scale.",1,Predicting whether two proteins physically interact is one of the holy grails of computational biology.

Surprisingly, we found a strong trend in the opposite direction-neural networks with high-dimensional image subspaces tended to have better generalization performance when predicting cortical responses to held-out stimuli in both monkey electrophysiology and human fMRI data.

Method to determine whether sleep phenotypes are driven by endogenous circadian rhythms or environmental light by combining longitudinal data and personalised mathematical models.,38134229,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38134229/,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011743,[],"Sleep timing varies between individuals and can be altered in mental and physical health conditions. Sleep and circadian sleep phenotypes, including circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, may be driven by endogenous physiological processes, exogeneous environmental light exposure along with social constraints and behavioural factors. Identifying the relative contributions of these driving factors to different phenotypes is essential for the design of personalised interventions. The timing of the human sleep-wake cycle has been modelled as an interaction of a relaxation oscillator (the sleep homeostat), a stable limit cycle oscillator with a near 24-hour period (the circadian process), man-made light exposure and the natural light-dark cycle generated by the Earth's rotation. However, these models have rarely been used to quantitatively describe sleep at the individual level. Here, we present a new Homeostatic-Circadian-Light model (HCL) which is simpler, more transparent and more computationally efficient than other available models and is designed to run using longitudinal sleep and light exposure data from wearable sensors. We carry out a systematic sensitivity analysis for all model parameters and discuss parameter identifiability. We demonstrate that individual sleep phenotypes in each of 34 older participants (65-83y) can be described by feeding individual participant light exposure patterns into the model and fitting two parameters that capture individual average sleep duration and timing. The fitted parameters describe endogenous drivers of sleep phenotypes. We then quantify exogenous drivers using a novel metric which encodes the circadian phase dependence of the response to light.

An agent-based modeling approach for lung fibrosis in response to COVID-19.,38127835,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38127835/,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011741,[],"The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic has created an emerging need to investigate the long-term effects of infection on patients. Many individuals are at risk of suffering pulmonary fibrosis due to the pathogenesis of lung injury and impairment in the healing mechanism. Fibroblasts are the central mediators of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition during tissue regeneration, regulated by anti-inflammatory cytokines including transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²). The TGF-Î²-dependent accumulation of fibroblasts at the damaged site and excess fibrillar collagen deposition lead to fibrosis. We developed an open-source, multiscale tissue simulator to investigate the role of TGF-Î² sources in the progression of lung fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, intracellular viral replication, infection of epithelial cells, and host immune response. Using the model, we predicted the dynamics of fibroblasts, TGF-Î², and collagen deposition for 15 days post-infection in virtual lung tissue. Our results showed variation in collagen area fractions between 2% and 40% depending on the spatial behavior of the sources (stationary or mobile), the rate of activation of TGF-Î², and the duration of TGF-Î² sources. We identified M2 macrophages as primary contributors to higher collagen area fraction. Our simulation results also predicted fibrotic outcomes even with lower collagen area fraction when spatially-localized latent TGF-Î² sources were active for longer times. We validated our model by comparing simulated dynamics for TGF-Î², collagen area fraction, and macrophage cell population with independent experimental data from mouse models. Our results showed that partial removal of TGF-Î² sources changed the fibrotic patterns; in the presence of persistent TGF-Î² sources, partial removal of TGF-Î² from the ECM significantly increased collagen area fraction due to maintenance of chemotactic gradients driving fibroblast movement. The computational findings are consistent with independent experimental and clinical observations of collagen area fractions and cell population dynamics not used in developing the model. These critical insights into the activity of TGF-Î² sources may find applications in the current clinical trials targeting TGF-Î² for the resolution of lung fibrosis.",2,Many individuals are at risk of suffering pulmonary fibrosis due to the pathogenesis of lung injury and impairment in the healing mechanism.
E2EATP: Fast and High-Accuracy Protein-ATP Binding Residue Prediction via Protein Language Model Embedding.,38127815,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38127815/,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01298,[],"Identifying the ATP-binding sites of proteins is fundamentally important to uncover the mechanisms of protein functions and explore drug discovery. Many computational methods are proposed to predict ATP-binding sites. However, due to the limitation of the quality of feature representation, the prediction performance still has a big room for improvement. In this study, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model, E2EATP, to dig out more discriminative information from a protein sequence for improving the ATP-binding site prediction performance. Concretely, we employ a pretrained deep learning-based protein language model (ESM2) to automatically extract high-latent discriminative representations of protein sequences relevant for protein functions. Based on ESM2, we design a residual convolutional neural network to train a protein-ATP binding site prediction model. Furthermore, a weighted focal loss function is used to reduce the negative impact of imbalanced data on the model training stage. Experimental results on the two independent testing data sets demonstrate that E2EATP could achieve higher Matthew's correlation coefficient and AUC values than most existing state-of-the-art prediction methods. The speed (about 0.05 s per protein) of E2EATP is much faster than the other existing prediction methods. Detailed data analyses show that the major advantage of E2EATP lies at the utilization of the pretrained protein language model that extracts more discriminative information from the protein sequence only.

It has a complex and heterogeneous etiology. Most treatments take weeks to show effects and work well only for a fraction of the patients. Thus, new concepts are needed to understand MDD and its dynamics. One of the strong correlates of MDD is increased activity and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which produces the stress hormone cortisol. Existing mathematical models of the HPA axis describe its operation on the scale of hours, and thus are unable to explore the dynamic on the scale of weeks that characterizes many aspects of MDD. Here, we propose a mathematical model of MDD on the scale of weeks, a timescale provided by the growth of the HPA hormone glands under control of HPA hormones. We add to this the mutual inhibition of the HPA axis and the hippocampus and other regions of the central nervous system (CNS) that forms a toggle switch. The model shows bistability between euthymic and depressed states, with a slow timescale of weeks in its dynamics. It explains why prolonged but not acute stress can trigger a self-sustaining depressive episode that persists even after the stress is removed. The model explains the weeks timescale for drugs to take effect, as well as the dysregulation of the HPA axis in MDD, based on gland mass changes.

While numerous computational methods have been proposed, the majority of existing approaches center on processing the target dataset itself. This approach disregards the wealth of knowledge present within other species and batches of scRNA-seq data. In light of this, our paper proposes a novel method named graph-based deep embedding clustering (GDEC) that leverages transfer learning across species and batches. GDEC integrates graph convolutional networks, effectively overcoming the challenges posed by sparse gene expression matrices. Additionally, the incorporation of DEC in GDEC enables the partitioning of cell clusters within a lower-dimensional space, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of noise on clustering outcomes. GDEC constructs a model based on existing scRNA-seq datasets and then applying transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the model using a limited amount of prior knowledge gleaned from the target dataset.

Previous sequencing methods were unable to achieve high-throughput detection of full-length eccDNAs. Herein, a novel algorithm was developed, called Full-Length eccDNA Detection (FLED), to reconstruct the sequence of eccDNAs based on the strategy that combined rolling circle amplification and nanopore long-reads sequencing technology. Seven human epithelial and cancer cell line samples were analyzed by FLED and over 5000 full-length eccDNAs were identified per sample. The structures of identified eccDNAs were validated by both Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. Compared to other published nanopore-based eccDNA detectors, FLED exhibited higher sensitivity. In cancer cell lines, the genes overlapped with eccDNA regions were enriched in cancer-related pathways and cis-regulatory elements can be predicted in the upstream or downstream of intact genes on eccDNA molecules, and the expressions of these cancer-related genes were dysregulated in tumor cell lines, indicating the regulatory potency of eccDNAs in biological processes. The proposed method takes advantage of nanopore long reads and enables unbiased reconstruction of full-length eccDNA sequences.

Although some computational methods have been developed for AD diagnosis, most employ only neuroimaging, ignoring other data (e.g., genetic, clinical) that may have potential disease information. In addition, the results of some methods lack interpretability. In this work, we proposed a novel method (called DANMLP) of joining dual attention convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) for computer-aided AD diagnosis by integrating multi-modality data of the structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), clinical data (i.e., demographics, neuropsychology), and APOE genetic data. Our DANMLP consists of four primary components: (1) the Patch-CNN for extracting the image characteristics from each local patch, (2) the position self-attention block for capturing the dependencies between features within a patch, (3) the channel self-attention block for capturing dependencies of inter-patch features, (4) two MLP networks for extracting the clinical features and outputting the AD classification results, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods in the 5CV test, DANMLP achieves 93% and 82.4% classification accuracy for the AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC tasks on the ADNI database, which is 0.2%âˆ¼15.2% and 3.4%âˆ¼26.8% higher than that of other five methods, respectively.

The tremendous emergency of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data brings new opportunities and challenges for GRN inference: the extensive dropouts and complicated noise structure may also degrade the performance of contemporary gene regulatory models. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more accurate methods for gene regulatory network inference in single-cell data while considering the noise structure at the same time. In this paper, we extend the traditional structural equation modeling (SEM) framework by considering a flexible noise modeling strategy, namely we use the Gaussian mixtures to approximate the complex stochastic nature of a biological system, since the Gaussian mixture framework can be arguably served as a universal approximation for any continuous distributions. The proposed non-Gaussian SEM framework is called NG-SEM, which can be optimized by iteratively performing Expectation-Maximization algorithm and weighted least-squares method. Moreover, the Akaike Information Criteria is adopted to select the number of components of the Gaussian mixture. To probe the accuracy and stability of our proposed method, we design a comprehensive variate of control experiments to systematically investigate the performance of NG-SEM under various conditions, including simulations and real biological data sets.

The purpose of this review is to organize this body of knowledge associated with phosphorylation site (p-site) prediction to facilitate future research in this field. At first, we comprehensively review all related databases and introduce all steps regarding dataset creation, data preprocessing, and method evaluation in p-site prediction. Next, we investigate p-site prediction methods, which are divided into two computational groups: algorithmic and machine learning (ML). Additionally, it is shown that there are basically two main approaches for p-site prediction by ML: conventional and end-to-end deep learning methods, both of which are given an overview. Moreover, this review introduces the most important feature extraction techniques, which have mostly been used in p-site prediction.

While new experimental and imaging techniques are beginning to provide a window on the complex processes that play out in these communities, resolving the behaviour of individual cells through time and space remains a major challenge. Although a number of different software solutions have been developed to track microorganisms, these typically require users either to tune a large number of parameters or to groundtruth a large volume of imaging data to train a deep learning model-both manual processes which can be very time consuming for novel experiments. To overcome these limitations, we have developed FAST, the Feature-Assisted Segmenter/Tracker, which uses unsupervised machine learning to optimise tracking while maintaining ease of use. Our approach, rooted in information theory, largely eliminates the need for users to iteratively adjust parameters manually and make qualitative assessments of the resulting cell trajectories. Instead, FAST measures multiple distinguishing 'features' for each cell and then autonomously quantifies the amount of unique information each feature provides. We then use these measurements to determine how data from different features should be combined to minimize tracking errors. Comparing our algorithm with a naÃ¯ve approach that uses cell position alone revealed that FAST produced 4 to 10 fold fewer tracking errors. The modular design of FAST combines our novel tracking method with tools for segmentation, extensive data visualisation, lineage assignment, and manual track correction. It is also highly extensible, allowing users to extract custom information from images and seamlessly integrate it into downstream analyses. FAST therefore enables high-throughput, data-rich analyses with minimal user input.

The results demonstrate that ScaffoldGVAE can explore the unseen chemical space and generate novel molecules distinct from known compounds. Especially, the scaffold hopped molecules generated by our model are validated by the evaluation of GraphDTA, LeDock, and MM/GBSA.

PLPCA: Persistent Laplacian-Enhanced PCA for Microarray Data Analysis.,37738663,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37738663/,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01023,[],"Over the years, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has served as the baseline approach for dimensionality reduction in gene expression data analysis. Its primary objective is to identify a subset of disease-causing genes from a vast pool of thousands of genes. However, PCA possesses inherent limitations that hinder its interpretability, introduce class ambiguity, and fail to capture complex geometric structures in the data. Although these limitations have been partially addressed in the literature by incorporating various regularizers, such as graph Laplacian regularization, existing PCA based methods still face challenges related to multiscale analysis and capturing higher-order interactions in the data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Persistent Laplacian-enhanced Principal Component Analysis (PLPCA). PLPCA amalgamates the advantages of earlier regularized PCA methods with persistent spectral graph theory, specifically persistent Laplacians derived from algebraic topology. In contrast to graph Laplacians, persistent Laplacians enable multiscale analysis through filtration and can incorporate higher-order simplicial complexes to capture higher-order interactions in the data. We evaluate and validate the performance of PLPCA using ten benchmark microarray data sets that exhibit a wide range of dimensions and data imbalance ratios. Our extensive studies over these data sets demonstrate that PLPCA provides up to 12% improvement to the current state-of-the-art PCA models on five evaluation metrics for classification tasks after dimensionality reduction.",4,Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has served as the baseline approach for dimensionality reduction in gene expression data analysis.

Mixtures of strategies underlie rodent behavior during reversal learning.,37708113,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37708113/,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011430,[],"In reversal learning tasks, the behavior of humans and animals is often assumed to be uniform within single experimental sessions to facilitate data analysis and model fitting. However, behavior of agents can display substantial variability in single experimental sessions, as they execute different blocks of trials with different transition dynamics. Here, we observed that in a deterministic reversal learning task, mice display noisy and sub-optimal choice transitions even at the expert stages of learning. We investigated two sources of the sub-optimality in the behavior. First, we found that mice exhibit a high lapse rate during task execution, as they reverted to unrewarded directions after choice transitions. Second, we unexpectedly found that a majority of mice did not execute a uniform strategy, but rather mixed between several behavioral modes with different transition dynamics. We quantified the use of such mixtures with a state-space model, block Hidden Markov Model (block HMM), to dissociate the mixtures of dynamic choice transitions in individual blocks of trials. Additionally, we found that blockHMM transition modes in rodent behavior can be accounted for by two different types of behavioral algorithms, model-free or inference-based learning, that might be used to solve the task. Combining these approaches, we found that mice used a mixture of both exploratory, model-free strategies and deterministic, inference-based behavior in the task, explaining their overall noisy choice sequences. Together, our combined computational approach highlights intrinsic sources of noise in rodent reversal learning behavior and provides a richer description of behavior than conventional techniques, while uncovering the hidden states that underlie the block-by-block transitions.",3,"In a reversal learning task, mice display noisy and sub-optimal choice transitions even at the expert stages of learning."

Due to PROTACs' hetero-bifunctional characteristics, in which a linker joins a warhead binding to a protein of interest (POI), conferring specificity and a E3-ligand binding to an E3 ubiquitin ligase, this could trigger the ubiquitination and transportation of POI to the proteasome, followed by degradation. The rational PROTAC linker design is challenging due to its relatively large molecular weight and the complexity of maintaining the binding mode of warhead and E3-ligand in the binding pockets of counterpart.

Common scores to evaluate epidemiological forecasts are the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and the Weighted Interval Score (WIS), which can be seen as measures of the absolute distance between the forecast distribution and the observation. However, applying these scores directly to predicted and observed incidence counts may not be the most appropriate due to the exponential nature of epidemic processes and the varying magnitudes of observed values across space and time. In this paper, we argue that transforming counts before applying scores such as the CRPS or WIS can effectively mitigate these difficulties and yield epidemiologically meaningful and easily interpretable results. Using the CRPS on log-transformed values as an example, we list three attractive properties: Firstly, it can be interpreted as a probabilistic version of a relative error. Secondly, it reflects how well models predicted the time-varying epidemic growth rate. And lastly, using arguments on variance-stabilizing transformations, it can be shown that under the assumption of a quadratic mean-variance relationship, the logarithmic transformation leads to expected CRPS values which are independent of the order of magnitude of the predicted quantity. Applying a transformation of log(x + 1) to data and forecasts from the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub, we find that it changes model rankings regardless of stratification by forecast date, location or target types. Situations in which models missed the beginning of upward swings are more strongly emphasised while failing to predict a downturn following a peak is less severely penalised when scoring transformed forecasts as opposed to untransformed ones. We conclude that appropriate transformations, of which the natural logarithm is only one particularly attractive option, should be considered when assessing the performance of different models in the context of infectious disease incidence.",2,"Common scores to evaluate epidemiological forecasts are the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and the Weighted Interval Score (WIS) However, applying these scores directly to predicted"

Here we performed a comprehensive pan-cancer comparison of molecular profiles of solid tumor-adjacent and autopsy-derived ""healthy"" normal tissues. We found a number of systemic molecular differences related to activation of the immune cells, intracellular transport and autophagy, cellular respiration, telomerase activation, p38 signaling, cytoskeleton remodeling, and reorganization of the extracellular matrix.

In this paper, we proposed a consensual machine-learning technique-based prediction approach to identify disease-related miRNAs and lncRNAs by high-order proximity preserved embedding (HOPE) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), named HOPEXGB. By connecting lncRNA, miRNA, and disease nodes based on their correlations and relationships, we first created a heterogeneous disease-miRNA-lncRNA (DML) information network to achieve an effective fusion of information on similarities, correlations, and interactions among miRNAs, lncRNAs, and diseases. In addition, a more rational negative data set was generated based on the similarities of unknown associations with the known ones, so as to effectively reduce the false negative rate in the data set for model construction.

This originates from differential ionization efficiency between peptides and thus, understanding the physicochemical properties that influence the ionization and response in MS analysis is essential for developing less restrictive label-free quantitative methods. Here, we used equimolar peptide pool repository data to develop a deep learning model capable of identifying amino acids influencing the MS1 response. By using an encoder-decoder with an attention mechanism and correlating attention weights with amino acid physicochemical properties, we obtain insight on properties governing the peptide-level MS1 response within the datasets.

However, complex ML models that are often perceived as opaque and black-box methods make it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their decisions. This lack of transparency can be a challenge for both end-users and decision-makers, as well as AI developers. In sensitive areas such as healthcare, explainability and accountability are not only desirable properties but also legally required for AI systems that can have a significant impact on human lives. Fairness is another growing concern, as algorithmic decisions should not show bias or discrimination towards certain groups or individuals based on sensitive attributes. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to overcome the opaqueness of black-box models and to provide transparency in how AI systems make decisions. Interpretable ML models can explain how they make predictions and identify factors that influence their outcomes. However, the majority of the state-of-the-art interpretable ML methods are domain-agnostic and have evolved from fields such as computer vision, automated reasoning or statistics, making direct application to bioinformatics problems challenging without customization and domain adaptation. In this paper, we discuss the importance of explainability and algorithmic transparency in the context of bioinformatics. We provide an overview of model-specific and model-agnostic interpretable ML methods and tools and outline their potential limitations. We discuss how existing interpretable ML methods can be customized and fit to bioinformatics research problems. Further, through case studies in bioimaging, cancer genomics and text mining, we demonstrate how XAI methods can improve transparency and decision fairness. Our review aims at providing valuable insights and serving as a starting point for researchers wanting to enhance explainability and decision transparency while solving bioinformatics problems.

According to a recent framework of attentional control, object selection is guided not only by the well-established factors of perceptual salience and current goals but also by selection history. Yet, underlying mechanisms linking selection history and visually-guided actions are poorly understood. To examine such interplay and disentangle the impact of target and distractor history on action selection, we employed a priming-of-popout (PoP) paradigm combined with continuous tracking of reaching movements and computational modeling. Participants reached an odd-colored target among homogeneous distractors while we systematically manipulated the sequence of target and distractor colors from one trial to the next. We observed that current reach movements were significantly influenced by the interaction between attraction by the prior target feature and repulsion by the prior distractor feature. With principal component regression, we found that inhibition led by prior distractors influenced reach target selection earlier than facilitation led by the prior target. In parallel, our newly developed computational model validated that current reach target selection can be explained best by the mechanism postulating the preceded impact of previous distractors followed by a previous target. Such converging empirical and computational evidence suggests that the prior selection history triggers a dynamic interplay between target facilitation and distractor inhibition to guide goal-directed action successfully. This, in turn, highlights the necessity of an explicitly integrated approach to determine how visual attentional selection links with adaptive actions in a complex environment.",1,The study looked at the impact of target and distractor history on action selection.

Existing methods, however, cannot integrate knowledge from various knowledge sources as prompts nor can fully utilize explicit and implicit knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a Medical Knowledge-enhanced Prompt Learning (MedKPL) diagnostic framework for transferable clinical note classification. Firstly, to overcome the heterogeneity of knowledge sources, such as knowledge graphs or medical QA databases, MedKPL uniform the knowledge relevant to the disease into text sequences of fixed format. Then, MedKPL integrates medical knowledge into the prompt designed for context representation. Therefore, MedKPL can integrate knowledge into the models to enhance diagnostic performance and effectively transfer to new diseases by using relevant disease knowledge. The results of our experiments on two medical datasets demonstrate that our method yields superior medical text classification results and performs better in cross-departmental transfer tasks under few-shot or even zero-shot settings. These findings demonstrate that our MedKPL framework has the potential to improve the interpretability and transferability of current diagnostic systems.",1,Artificial Intelligence (AI) based diagnosis systems have emerged as powerful tools to reform traditional medical care.

Protein kinases have conserved ATP binding sites, which when targeted can lead to similar activities of inhibitors against different kinases. This can be exploited to create multitarget drugs. On the other hand, selectivity (lack of similar activities) is desirable in order to avoid toxicity issues. There is a vast amount of protein kinase activity data in the public domain, which can be used in many different ways. Multitask machine learning models are expected to excel for these kinds of data sets because they can learn from implicit correlations between tasks (in this case activities against a variety of kinases). However, multitask modeling of sparse data poses two major challenges: (i) creating a balanced train-test split without data leakage and (ii) handling missing data. In this work, we construct a protein kinase benchmark set composed of two balanced splits without data leakage, using random and dissimilarity-driven cluster-based mechanisms, respectively. This data set can be used for benchmarking and developing protein kinase activity prediction models. Overall, the performance on the dissimilarity-driven cluster-based split is lower than on random split-based sets for all models, indicating poor generalizability of models. Nevertheless, we show that multitask deep learning models, on this very sparse data set, outperform single-task deep learning and tree-based models. Finally, we demonstrate that data imputation does not improve the performance of (multitask) models on this benchmark set.",2,Protein kinases are a protein family that plays an important role in several complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular and immunological diseases.

Data shows that the SMT influences the musician's tempo and synchronization. In this study we present a model that captures these phenomena. We review the results from three previously-published studies: solo musical performance with a pacing metronome tempo that is different from the SMT, solo musical performance without a metronome at a tempo that is faster or slower than the SMT, and duet musical performance between musicians with matching or mismatching SMTs. These studies showed, respectively, that the asynchrony between the pacing metronome and the musician's tempo grew as a function of the difference between the metronome tempo and the musician's SMT, musicians drifted away from the initial tempo toward the SMT, and the absolute asynchronies were smaller if musicians had matching SMTs. We hypothesize that the SMT constantly acts as a pulling force affecting musical actions at a tempo different from a musician's SMT. To test our hypothesis, we developed a model consisting of a non-linear oscillator with Hebbian tempo learning and a pulling force to the model's spontaneous frequency. While the model's spontaneous frequency emulates the SMT, elastic Hebbian learning allows for frequency learning to match a stimulus' frequency. To test our hypothesis, we first fit model parameters to match the data in the first of the three studies and asked whether this same model would explain the data the remaining two studies without further tuning. Results showed that the model's dynamics allowed it to explain all three experiments with the same set of parameters. Our theory offers a dynamical-systems explanation of how an individual's SMT affects synchronization in realistic music performance settings, and the model also enables predictions about performance settings not yet tested.",3,"A musician's spontaneous rate of movement, called spontaneous motor tempo (SMT), can be measured while spontaneously playing a simple melody."

Exploring this immune mechanism is essential for identifying T-cell vaccine targets in cancer immunotherapy. Over the past decade, the wealth of data generated by experiments has spawned many computational approaches for predicting HLA-I binding, antigen presentation and T-cell immune responses. Nevertheless, existing HLA-I binding and antigen presentation prediction approaches suffer from low precision due to the absence of T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition. Direct modeling of T-cell immune responses is less effective as TCR recognition's mechanism still remains underexplored. Therefore, directly applying these existing methods to screen cancer neoantigens is still challenging.

First, IEPAPI employs a transformer-based feature extraction block to acquire representations of peptides and HLA-I proteins. Second, IEPAPI integrates the prediction of antigen presentation prediction into the input of immunogenicity prediction branch to simulate the connection between the biological processes in the T-cell immune response.

We illustrate this scenario using a computational modelling framework comprising sequence-based structure prediction and all-atom 1 Âµs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in a lipid membrane for a previously characterised oncogenic TM mutation V536E in platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA). We show that in the course of MD simulations the mutant TM tetramer retains stable and compact configuration strengthened by tight protein-protein interactions, while the wild type TM tetramer demonstrates looser packing and a tendency to dissociate. Moreover, the mutation affects the characteristic motions of mutated TM helical segments by introducing additional non-covalent crosslinks in the middle of the TM tetramer, which operate as mechanical hinges. This leads to dynamic decoupling of the C-termini from the rigidified N-terminal parts and facilitates more pronounced possible displacement between the C-termini of the mutant TM helical regions that can provide more freedom for mutual rearrangement of the kinase domains located downstream. Our results for the V536E mutation in the context of PDGFRA TM tetramer allow for the possibility that the effect of oncogenic TM mutations can go beyond alternating the structure and dynamics of TM dimeric states and might also promote the formation of higher-order oligomers directly contributing to ligand-independent signalling effectuated by PDGFRA and other RTKs.",1,"Constantutive activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) via different mutations has a strong impact on the development of severe human disorders, including cancer."

In this paper, we first review commonly used mtPRS methods and find that they do not directly model the underlying genetic correlations among traits, which has been shown to be useful in guiding multi-trait association analysis in the literature.

Importantly, the perturbed S1 pocket dynamics weaken the nirmatrelvir binding in the P1 position, which explains the decreased inhibitory activity of nirmatrelvir. Our work demonstrates the predictive power of the combined simulation and artificial intelligence approaches, and together with biochemical experiments, they can be used to actively surveil continually emerging mutations of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and assist the optimization of antiviral drugs. The presented approach, in general, can be applied to characterize mutation effects on any protein drug targets.",1,"Nirmatrelvir is an orally available inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) It is the main ingredient of Paxlovid, a drug"

Given that more such data sets will become available in the near future, their accurate assessment with compatible and robust models for cell type annotation is a prerequisite. Considering this, herein, we developed scAnno (scRNA-seq data annotation), an automated annotation tool for scRNA-seq data sets primarily based on the single-cell cluster levels, using a joint deconvolution strategy and logistic regression. We explicitly constructed a reference profile for human (30 cell types and 50 human tissues) and a reference profile for mouse (26 cell types and 50 mouse tissues) to support this novel methodology (scAnno). scAnno offers a possibility to obtain genes with high expression and specificity in a given cell type as cell type-specific genes (marker genes) by combining co-expression genes with seed genes as a core. Of importance, scAnno can accurately identify cell type-specific genes based on cell type reference expression profiles without any prior information. Particularly, in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set, the marker genes identified by scAnno showed cell type-specific expression, and the majority of marker genes matched exactly with those included in the CellMarker database. Besides validating the flexibility and interpretability of scAnno in identifying marker genes, we also proved its superiority in cell type annotation over other cell type annotation tools (SingleR, scPred, CHETAH and scmap-cluster) through internal validation of data sets (average annotation accuracy: 99.05%) and cross-platform data sets (average annotation accuracy: 95.56%). Taken together, we established the first novel methodology that utilizes a deconvolution strategy for automated cell typing and is capable of being a significant application in broader scRNA-seq analysis. scAnno is available at https://github.com/liuhong-jia/scAnno.",3,"ScRNA-seq has changed the research landscape by providing insights into heterogeneous, complex and rare cell populations."

As a proof of concept, we applied UniDesign to decode the PAM-PIAA interactions for eight Cas9 and two Cas12a proteins. We show that, given native PIAAs, the UniDesign-predicted PAMs are largely identical to the natural PAMs of all Cas proteins. In turn, given natural PAMs, the computationally redesigned PIAA residues largely recapitulated the native PIAAs (74% and 86% in terms of identity and similarity, respectively). These results demonstrate that UniDesign faithfully captures the mutual preference between natural PAMs and native PIAAs, suggesting it is a useful tool for engineering CRISPR-Cas and other nucleic acid-interacting proteins.

Metastatic cancer involves the spread of the primary tumor to other body organs. As much as the early detection of cancer is essential, the timely detection of metastasis, the identification of biomarkers, and treatment choice are valuable for improving the quality of life for metastatic cancer patients. This study reviews the existing studies on classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in metastatic cancer research. Since the majority of metastatic cancer research data are collected in the formats of PET/CT and MRI image data, deep learning techniques are heavily involved. However, its black-box nature and expensive computational cost are notable concerns. Furthermore, existing models could be overestimated for their generality due to the non-diverse population in clinical trial datasets. Therefore, research gaps are itemized; follow-up studies should be carried out on metastatic cancer using machine learning and deep learning tools with data in a symmetric manner.",1,Metastatic cancer involves the spread of the primary tumor to other body organs.

Recent theories suggested that AM and the predictive activities of the hippocampus could be described within a unitary account, and that predictive coding underlies the computations supporting AM in the hippocampus. Following this theory, a computational model based on classical hierarchical predictive networks was proposed and was shown to perform well in various AM tasks. However, this fully hierarchical model did not incorporate recurrent connections, an architectural component of the CA3 region of the hippocampus that is crucial for AM. This makes the structure of the model inconsistent with the known connectivity of CA3 and classical recurrent models such as Hopfield Networks, which learn the covariance of inputs through their recurrent connections to perform AM. Earlier PC models that learn the covariance information of inputs explicitly via recurrent connections seem to be a solution to these issues. Here, we show that although these models can perform AM, they do it in an implausible and numerically unstable way. Instead, we propose alternatives to these earlier covariance-learning predictive coding networks, which learn the covariance information implicitly and plausibly, and can use dendritic structures to encode prediction errors. We show analytically that our proposed models are perfectly equivalent to the earlier predictive coding model learning covariance explicitly, and encounter no numerical issues when performing AM tasks in practice. We further show that our models can be combined with hierarchical predictive coding networks to model the hippocampo-neocortical interactions. Our models provide a biologically plausible approach to modelling the hippocampal network, pointing to a potential computational mechanism during hippocampal memory formation and recall, which employs both predictive coding and covariance learning based on the recurrent network structure of the hippocampus.",3,The computational principles adopted by the hippocampus in associative memory (AM) tasks have been one of the most studied topics in computational and theoretical neuroscience.

The changes in depression involved a combination of an aperiodic broadband and periodic theta components. We then demonstrated the specificity of the EEG signatures of reduced SST interneuron inhibition by showing they were distinct from those corresponding to reduced parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneuron inhibition.

Here we present an agent-based model that simulates muscle repair in response to both localised eccentric contractions similar to what would be experienced during exercise, and non-localised widespread inflammatory damage that is present in chronic disease. Computational modelling of muscle repair allows for in silico exploration of phenomena related to muscle disease. In our model, widespread inflammation led to delayed clearance of tissue damage, and delayed repair for recovery of initial fibril counts at all damage levels. Macrophage recruitment was delayed and significantly higher in widespread compared to localised damage. At higher damage percentages of 10%, widespread damage led to impaired muscle regeneration and changes in muscle geometry that represented alterations commonly observed in chronic myopathies, such as fibrosis.

Pleiotropy promotes the evolution of inducible immune responses in a model of host-pathogen coevolution.,37022993,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37022993/,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010445,[],"Components of immune systems face significant selective pressure to efficiently use organismal resources, mitigate infection, and resist parasitic manipulation. A theoretically optimal immune defense balances investment in constitutive and inducible immune components depending on the kinds of parasites encountered, but genetic and dynamic constraints can force deviation away from theoretical optima. One such potential constraint is pleiotropy, the phenomenon where a single gene affects multiple phenotypes. Although pleiotropy can prevent or dramatically slow adaptive evolution, it is prevalent in the signaling networks that compose metazoan immune systems. We hypothesized that pleiotropy is maintained in immune signaling networks despite slowed adaptive evolution because it provides some other advantage, such as forcing network evolution to compensate in ways that increase host fitness during infection. To study the effects of pleiotropy on the evolution of immune signaling networks, we used an agent-based modeling approach to evolve a population of host immune systems infected by simultaneously co-evolving parasites. Four kinds of pleiotropic restrictions on evolvability were incorporated into the networks, and their evolutionary outcomes were compared to, and competed against, non-pleiotropic networks. As the networks evolved, we tracked several metrics of immune network complexity, relative investment in inducible and constitutive defenses, and features associated with the winners and losers of competitive simulations. Our results suggest non-pleiotropic networks evolve to deploy highly constitutive immune responses regardless of parasite prevalence, but some implementations of pleiotropy favor the evolution of highly inducible immunity. These inducible pleiotropic networks are no less fit than non-pleiotropic networks and can out-compete non-pleiotropic networks in competitive simulations. These provide a theoretical explanation for the prevalence of pleiotropic genes in immune systems and highlight a mechanism that could facilitate the evolution of inducible immune responses.",1,The authors say pleiotropy is prevalent in the signaling networks that compose metazoan immune systems.

Benchmarking the Drude Polarizable Force Field Using the r(GACC) Tetranucleotide.,36996447,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36996447/,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00250,[],"Polarizable force fields, in particular, the Drude polarizable force field (Drude FF), may hold the key to more accurately modeling biomolecules with molecular dynamics simulations by explicitly accounting for atomic polarizability. Previous work has shown promising results in simulating duplex nucleic acids and protein structures with excellent agreement with experimental values. However, benchmarking the Drude polarizable force field with highly flexible, single-stranded structures has yet to be achieved. In this work, the r(GACC) tetranucleotide is simulated over a multimicrosecond time scale, starting with various different initial conformations. Despite the starting conformation, including starting from the expected dominant A-form major conformation, the experimental structural distribution is not matched. In fact, the major NMR conformation is never resampled. Instead, the r(GACC) tetranucleotide becomes stabilized in anomalous structures that are inconsistent with the NMR data and that favor base-pairing and electrostatic interactions over base stacking. These structures are maintained for lengthy time scales (>1 Î¼s) themselves, suggesting a misbalance of forces in the Drude polarizable force field itself. This model system is suggestive of the fact that currently the Drude polarizable force field does not appear to produce the sensitive balance of forces required to accurately model other single-stranded or noncanonical RNA structures.",1,"Polarizable force fields, in particular, the Drude polarizable force field (Drude FF), may hold the key to more accurately modeling biomolecules with molecular dynamics simulations."

Machine learning was used to identify PTM clusters that represent functional modules that respond to TKIs. To model lung cancer signaling at the protein level, PTM clusters were used to create a co-cluster correlation network (CCCN) and select protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from a large network of curated PPIs to create a cluster-filtered network (CFN). Next, we constructed a Pathway Crosstalk Network (PCN) by connecting pathways from NCATS BioPlanet whose member proteins have PTMs that co-cluster. Interrogating the CCCN, CFN, and PCN individually and in combination yields insights into the response of lung cancer cells to TKIs. We highlight examples where cell signaling pathways involving EGFR and ALK exhibit crosstalk with BioPlanet pathways: Transmembrane transport of small molecules; and Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. These data identify known and previously unappreciated connections between receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signal transduction and oncogenic metabolic reprogramming in lung cancer. Comparison to a CFN generated from a previous multi-PTM analysis of lung cancer cell lines reveals a common core of PPIs involving heat shock/chaperone proteins, metabolic enzymes, cytoskeletal components, and RNA-binding proteins.

RNA interactions, which are of highly diverse nature, are determined by the fact that RNA is a highly negatively charged polyelectrolyte, which leads to intimate interactions with an ion atmosphere. Although RNA molecules are formally single-stranded, canonical (Watson-Crick) duplexes are key components of folded RNAs. A double-stranded (ds) RNA is also important for the design of RNA-based nanostructures and assemblies. Despite the fact that the description of canonical dsRNA is considered the least problematic part of RNA modeling, the imperfect shape and flexibility of dsRNA can lead to imbalances in the simulations of larger RNAs and RNA-containing assemblies. We present a comprehensive set of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of four canonical A-RNA duplexes. Our focus was directed toward the characterization of the influence of varying ion concentrations and of the size of the solvation box. We compared several water models and four RNA force fields. The simulations showed that the A-RNA shape was most sensitive to the RNA force field, with some force fields leading to a reduced inclination of the A-RNA duplexes. The ions and water models played a minor role. The effect of the box size was negligible, and even boxes with a small fraction of the bulk solvent outside the RNA hydration sphere were sufficient for the simulation of the dsRNA.",3, RNA molecules play a key role in countless biochemical processes.

These are one of the most common post-translational modifications of proteins in eukaryotic cells. They play important roles in protein folding, cell-cell interactions, and other extracellular processes. Changes in glycan structures may influence the course of different diseases, such as infections or cancer. Glycans are commonly represented using the IUPAC-condensed notation. IUPAC-condensed is a textual representation of glycans operating on the same topological level as the Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG) that assigns colored, geometrical shapes to the main monomers. These symbols are then connected in tree-like structures, visualizing the glycan structure on a topological level.

To our knowledge, there is no easy-to-use, general, open-source, and offline tool to convert the IUPAC-condensed notation to SMILES. Here, we present the open-access Python package GlyLES for the generalizable generation of SMILES representations out of IUPAC-condensed representations. GlyLES uses a grammar to read in the monomer tree from the IUPAC-condensed notation. From this tree, the tool can compute the atomic structures of each monomer based on their IUPAC-condensed descriptions. In the last step, it merges all monomers into the atomic structure of a glycan in the SMILES notation. GlyLES is the first package that allows conversion from the IUPAC-condensed notation of glycans to SMILES strings.

Effective use of external text data could improve prediction accuracy, but existing methods cannot extract key information from external data accurately and reasonably, resulting in low utilization of external data.

The proposed framework integrates the article-level and sentence-level position information of the instances into the model to strengthen the connections between instances generated from the same article or sentence. Moreover, we introduce a comprehensive similarity-matching method that uses string and word sense similarity to improve the matching accuracy between the target drug and external text. Furthermore, the key sentence search method is used to obtain key information from external data. Therefore, IK-DDI can make full use of the connection between instances and the information contained in external text data to improve the efficiency of DDI extraction.

A key question in these studies is which gene expression changes are important for the response to the perturbation. This problem is challenging because (i) the functional form of the nonlinear relationship between gene expression and the perturbation is unknown and (ii) identification of the most important genes is a high-dimensional variable selection problem. To deal with these challenges, we present here a method based on the model-X knockoffs framework and Deep Neural Networks to identify significant gene expression changes in multiple perturbation experiments. This approach makes no assumptions on the functional form of the dependence between the responses and the perturbations and it enjoys finite sample false discovery rate control for the selected set of important gene expression responses. We apply this approach to the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signature data sets which is a National Institutes of Health Common Fund program that catalogs how human cells globally respond to chemical, genetic and disease perturbations. We identified important genes whose expression is directly modulated in response to perturbation with anthracycline, vorinostat, trichostatin-a, geldanamycin and sirolimus. We compare the set of important genes that respond to these small molecules to identify co-responsive pathways. Identification of which genes respond to specific perturbation stressors can provide better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of disease and advance the identification of new drug targets.",2,Large-scale multiple perturbation experiments have the potential to reveal a more detailed understanding of the molecular pathways that respond to genetic and environmental changes.

Efficient characterization of PPIs at the molecular level is key to the fundamental understanding of PPI mechanisms. Even with the gigantic amount of PPI models from graphs, networks, geometry and topology, it remains as a great challenge to design functional models that efficiently characterize the complicated multiphysical information within PPIs. Here we propose persistent Tor-algebra (PTA) model for a unified algebraic representation of the multiphysical interactions. Mathematically, our PTA is inherently algebraic data analysis. In our PTA model, protein structures and interactions are described as a series of face rings and Tor modules, from which PTA model is developed. The multiphysical information within/between biomolecules are implicitly characterized by PTA and further represented as PTA barcodes. To test our PTA models, we consider PTA-based ensemble learning for PPI binding affinity prediction. The two most commonly used datasets, i.e. SKEMPI and AB-Bind, are employed. It has been found that our model outperforms all the existing models as far as we know. Mathematically, our PTA model provides a highly efficient way for the characterization of molecular structures and interactions.",1,Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play crucial roles in almost all biological processes.

One such task is the reaction yield prediction. Every year more than one fifth of all synthesis attempts result in product yields which are either zero or too low. This equates to chemical and human resources being spent on activities which ultimately do not progress the programs, leading to a triple loss when accounting for the cost of opportunity in time wasted. In this work we pre-train a BERT model on more than 16 million reactions from 4 different data sources, and fine tune it to achieve an uncertainty calibrated global yield prediction model. This model is an improvement upon state of the art not just from the increase in pre-train data but also by introducing a new embedding layer which solves a few limitations of SMILES and enables integration of additional information such as equivalents and molecule role into the reaction encoding, the model is called BERT Enriched Embedding (BEE). The model is benchmarked on an open-source dataset against a state-of-the-art synthesis focused BERT showing a near 20-point improvement in r2 score. The model is fine-tuned and tested on an internal company data benchmark, and a prospective study shows that the application of the model can reduce the total number of negative reactions (yield under 5%) ran in Janssen by at least 34%.

Based on the best-performing XGBoost algorithm, 20 classification models were further constructed for 17 types of chronic diseases, including 9 types of cancers, 5 types of cardiovascular diseases and 3 types of mental illness.

Here we present an empirically constrained model of its action potential based on electrophysiology experiments on live immobilized paramecia, together with simultaneous measurement of ciliary beating using particle image velocimetry.

The genes that encode their biosynthesis are often physically clustered on the genome in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Many BGCs consist of multiple groups of co-evolving genes called sub-clusters that are responsible for the biosynthesis of a specific chemical moiety in a natural product. Sub-clusters therefore provide an important link between the structures of a natural product and its BGC, which can be leveraged for predicting natural product structures from sequence, as well as for linking chemical structures and metabolomics-derived mass features to BGCs. While some initial computational methodologies have been devised for sub-cluster detection, current approaches are not scalable, have only been run on small and outdated datasets, or produce an impractically large number of possible sub-clusters to mine through. Here, we constructed a scalable method for unsupervised sub-cluster detection, called iPRESTO, based on topic modelling and statistical analysis of co-occurrence patterns of enzyme-coding protein families. iPRESTO was used to mine sub-clusters across 150,000 prokaryotic BGCs from antiSMASH-DB. After annotating a fraction of the resulting sub-cluster families, we could predict a substructure for 16% of the antiSMASH-DB BGCs. Additionally, our method was able to confirm 83% of the experimentally characterised sub-clusters in MIBiG reference BGCs. Based on iPRESTO-detected sub-clusters, we could correctly identify the BGCs for xenorhabdin and salbostatin biosynthesis (which had not yet been annotated in BGC databases), as well as propose a candidate BGC for akashin biosynthesis. Additionally, we show for a collection of 145 actinobacteria how substructures can aid in linking BGCs to molecules by correlating iPRESTO-detected sub-clusters to MS/MS-derived Mass2Motifs substructure patterns.

As a rare freshwater-dwelling cartilaginous fish in the Potamotrygonidae family in which no member has the genome sequencing information available, P. leopoldi provides the evolutionary details in fish phylogeny, niche adaptation, and skeleton formation. In this study, we present its draft genome of 4.11Â Gb comprising 16,227 contigs and 13,238 scaffolds, with contig N50 of 3937Â kb and scaffold N50 of 5675Â kb in size. Our analysis shows that P. leopoldi is a slow-evolving fish that diverged from elephant sharks about 96 million years ago. Moreover, two gene families related to the immune system (immunoglobulin heavy constant delta genes and T-cell receptor alpha/delta variable genes) exhibit expansion in P. leopoldi only. We also identified the Hox gene clusters in P. leopoldi and discovered that seven Hox genes shared by five representative fish species are missing in P. leopoldi. The RNA sequencing data from P. leopoldi and other three fish species demonstrate that fishes have a more diversified tissue expression spectrum when compared to mammals. Our functional studies suggest that lack of the gc gene encoding vitamin D-binding protein in cartilaginous fishes (both P. leopoldi and Callorhinchus milii) could partly explain the absence of hard bone in their endoskeleton. Overall, this genome resource provides new insights into the niche adaptation, body plan, and skeleton formation of P. leopoldi, as well as the genome evolution in cartilaginous fishes.",1,"The white-blotched river stingray (Potamotrygon leopoldi) is a cartilaginous fish native to the Xingu River, a tribut"

However, manual inspection of tumors from MRI scans requires a large amount of time and it is also an error-prone process. Therefore, automated diagnosis of tumors plays a crucial role in clinical management and surgical interventions of gliomas. In this study, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based framework for non-invasive grading of tumors from 3D MRI scans. The proposed framework incorporates two novel CNN architectures. The first CNN architecture performs the segmentation of tumors from multimodel MRI volumes. The proposed segmentation network leverages the spatial and channel attention modules to recalibrate the feature maps across the layers. The second network utilizes the multi-task learning strategy to perform the classification based on the three glioma grading tasks which include characterization of tumor into low-grade or high-grade, identification of 1p19q, and Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) status. We have carried out several experiments to evaluate the performance of our method. Extensive experimental observations indicate that the proposed framework achieves better performance than several state-of-the-art methods.

In the present work, a computational framework named as BRMCF has been proposed for analysing the prediction capability of chemical and biological properties of drugs toward drug functions in view of multi-label nature of problem.

Existing methods for lncRNA-disease association prediction mainly focus on multi-sourced data related to lncRNAs and diseases. The rich semantic information of meta-paths, composed of multiple kinds of connections between lncRNA and disease nodes, is neglected. We propose a new prediction method, MGLDA, to encode and integrate the semantics of multiple meta-paths, the global topology of heterogeneous graph, and pairwise attributes of lncRNA and disease nodes. First, a tri-layer heterogeneous graph is constructed to associate multi-sourced data across the lncRNA, disease, and miRNA nodes. Afterwards, we establish multiple meta-paths connecting the lncRNA and disease nodes to derive and denote various semantics. Each meta-path contains its specific semantics formulated by an embedding strategy, and each embedding covers local topology formed by the diverse semantic connections among the lncRNA, disease, and miRNA nodes. We construct multiple graph convolutional autoencoders (GCA) with topology-level attention to learn global and multiple local topologies from the tri-layer graph and each meta-path, respectively. The topology-level attention mechanism can learn the importance of various global and local topologies for adaptive pairwise topology fusion. Finally, a convolutional autoencoder learns the attribute representations of lncRNA-disease pairs, which integrates the learnt detailed and representative pairwise features. Experimental results show that MGLDA outperforms other state-of-the-art prediction methods in comparison and retrieves more real lncRNA-disease associations in the top-ranked candidates.

Then, the convolutional neural network will automatically learn an appropriate feature representation for the sgRNA sequence and combine it with the positional information for self-attention learning of the Transformer.
